Welcome to my website! My name is Saam Rasool and I'm a senior at Columbia studying materials science. Two years ago, I transferred to Columbia from Colby college, where I majored in mathematics, as part of a dual degree program. I'm most interested in the energy industry and the materials that make it go, but am nearly as interested in everything else in the world, so there's a good chance this site won't be solely dedicated to engineering. I created this site to give myself and others easier access to some of the work I've done over the past few years, my CV and other random things.

My other interests include playing chess, rock climbing, baking, and birdwatching. I also learned how to hackeysack with one of my friends from Columbia this year (and we got pretty good at it too)! I will be near Boston for the foreseeable future, and am looking forward to spending time with friends and family, and maybe even contributing more to this site. Thanks for reading!
