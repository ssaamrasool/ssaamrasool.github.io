Welcome to my website. My name is Saam and I'm a recent college grad working as an engineer in Boston. From 2021-2023 I studied materials science at Columbia University, and from 2018-2021, mathematics at Colby College. I'm most interested in the energy industry and the materials that make it possible, but am nearly as interested in everything else in the world, so this site won't be solely dedicated to engineering. I created this site to give myself and others easier access to some of the work I've done over the past few years, my CV, and other important things.

My other interests include playing chess (among other board games), music, and video games, climbing, and birdwatching. I will be in Boston for the foreseeable future, and am looking forward to spending time with friends and family!
